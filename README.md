Dated Journal Entry <strong> (CPNT-260) </strong>
<h2> Feb 4, 2022 </h2>
Self Assessment:

- Practiced Javascript basics in class.
- Tried to utilize making a hamburger menu for my navbar Hero section assignment (Assignment 4).
- Used `.active` in CSS:
    -  `navbar-links.active {}`
    - makes it so that it can be activated <em>ON/OFF</em> in js

Troubleshooting:
 - could not figure out why my script.js file was not being recognized on my <strong>index.html</strong> file
  - Had to go on <em>Youtube</em> and follow tutorials for the Hamburger Nav Menu
      - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg" target="_blank">Responsive Navbar Tutorial by "Web Dev Simplified"</a>

TODO:
 - Add transformation animations for the Hamburger Menu

Self Assessment:
  - Practiced Grid Layouts for the Products Assignment (cpnt-260a2)
  - Experimented with the css command

 ```
    grid-template-areas: 
    "header header"
    "sidebar content"
    "sidebar content" 
  ```
  - Came across a new color expression: `hsl()` in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl()" target="_blank">MDN-hsl</a>.
    - Great for changing a colours `hsl (hue saturation opacity)`.

Class Work:
  - Did the <strong>"404 Error"</strong>Class Activity. <a href="https://codepen.io/tseidolon/pen/yLPYLNB" target="_blank">404 Codepen Activity</a>.
Attribution:
  - Wikipedia is great for specific png images under fair use licenses. searchign for "free png images" on google also works wonders.
  - I have my <em>attributions</em> for my assignments on my <a href="https://github.com/TSEidolon/cpnt260-a1" target="_blank">README.md</a> files such as this one.

Troubleshooting:
  - Tried to do grid but i wanted to edit the left margin of row 2 without affecting the other rows. 
    - ` grid-template-rows: minmax(150px 200px);`
    - Did not succeed. It just edits the size of the rows as a whole.

Self assessment:
 - Practice <em> Flex Box </em> more by redoing the Navigation assignment 
   - landed on a more visually appealing final product:
      - <a href="https://codepen.io/tseidolon/pen/ZEXddbR" target="_blank"> "Old Navigation bar (January 21)" </a>
      - <a href="https://codepen.io/tseidolon/pen/ExbYLGP" target="_blank"> "New Navigation bar (January 24) </a>

Class Work:
 - Experimented with different transitions for the `:hover{}` property
   - `transition: color 300ms linear` seemed great for this use case.
 - Wanted to use color hues that were similar to the ones that were used in the ‘Harry Potter’ movie posters
   - Downloaded <strong> “Color Picker” </strong> extension for Google Chrome


Troubleshooting:
 - Ran into a problem with the `hover{}` property → cause = placed in the wrong nested element? `(nav-items)`
   - solution = moved into the right nest `(nav-items-categories)`

<h2> Jan 20, 2022 </h2>

Self assessment:
 - I want to practice CSS layouts
   - utilize the `float` property to make images float beside a text
      - Did not figure out how to place beside the actual text; ended up on the other side of the page? (check code pen link below for visualization)
   - font-family usage

Proof of Work:
 - created a Wiki article activity on <strong> Codepen </strong> utilizing the `float` property
   -  <a href="https://codepen.io/tseidolon/pen/XWeLNdz" target="_blank"> "Harry Potter Wiki Article Activity" </a>

Research:
 - "image beside heading html" --> `<h1><img src="img/logo.png" alt="logo" /> My website name</h1>` 
   - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11701311/logo-image-and-h1-heading-on-the-same-line" target="_blank">  "stackoverflow" </a>
 - "CSS float" --> `img {float: right;}`
