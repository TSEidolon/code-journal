# Code Journal
Dated Journal Entries <strong> (DSGN 270) </strong>
## Jan 19, 2022
Self assessment:
 - I want to practice HTML by using it in VS code instead of markdown to write journals
Self Assessment Metrics:
 - 2 hours of the 6 hour Udemy course finished HTML and CSS 
   - lacking practice, basics done

Class-notes:
 - <a href="https://github.com/TSEidolon/in-class/blob/main/01-19/in_class_notes.html" target="_blank">"01-19 class notes in html"  </a>
  - <a href="https://github.com/TSEidolon/in-class/blob/main/01-19/css/styles-01-19.css" target="_blank">"CSS using font styles covered in class"  </a>
   - Tried to write class notes in HTML. 
   - Looks horrible but it'll do. 

Searched on google:
 - "Html font color" → `<p style="color:#0896db">#0896db</p>`

 - "link a url HTML" → `<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp" target="_blank"> “text” </a> `
     - target=”_blank” opens the link in a new tab

To do:
 - practice CSS
 - Assignment 1 and 2 for DSGN 270

- Writing my first journal entry. A bit confused using git and github. Im surprised on how easy it is to connect your local code?/server with your remote github.
- I need to learn HTML and CSS soon.
